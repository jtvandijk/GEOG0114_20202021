# Geostatistics

Following on from Week 3 and in conjunction with this week in your CASA005 module, we will also be focusing on rasters, exploring further the creation and application of rasters from vector datasets using geostatistics. During the lecture, we will provide a more in-depth and detailed explanation behind the geostatistics methods of interpolation, looking at various deterministic and geostatistical techniques. We then introduce methods to using vector datasets with rasters, utilizing a GIS method known as zonal statistics.
