This module provides an introduction into the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis essential for your career as a Data Scientist. This module has been designed in conjunction with your module on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Science (GIScience) from CASA to provide you with an extensive introduction into GIScience, spatial analysis and their associated tools. It has a specific focus on the principles, properties and parameters that are part of spatial analysis and how to understand and apply these effectively within geographic and data science-oriented research. The first half of the module provides detailed introductions into spatial concepts such as scale and geography, spatial dependency and autocorrelation, and spatial heterogeneity and spatial regression models. The second half then focuses on the applications of spatial analysis within current data science research, including cluster analysis and Bayesian modelling.

["course-information.html", "Course information Module structure Weekly topics Learning objectives Reading list Module assessment details Useful additional resources", " Course information Module structure This module consists of ten self-led workshops, ten interactive seminar discussions and ten help sessions. Each week, we’ll provide an online workshop, provided as a worksheet with videos and instructions to complete the practical component of the workshop. All online classes will be held on the Principles of Spatial Analysis ‘team’. In addition, each week will have its own reading list or additional ‘recommended’ (optional, not required!) online tutorials we know of that you might want to also complete. Weekly topics Week Date Topic 1 05/10/2020 Spatial analysis for data science 2 12/10/2020 Representation, scale and geography in spatial analysis 3 19/10/2020 Spatial properties, relationships and operations 4 26/10/2020 Spatial dependence, spatial autocorrelation and defining neighbours 5 02/11/2020 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis reading week reading week reading week 6 16/11/2020 Point pattern analysis 7 23/11/2020 Raster data and geostatistics 8 30/11/2020 Spatial analysis for urban (mapping) applications 9 07/12/2020 Geodemographics 10 14/12/2020 Reproducible research Learning objectives By the end of the module, you should: have a good understanding of the principles underlying the analysis of spatial data in general and spatial statistics in particular; be able to use GIS software and tools for generating and visualising summary statistics; be able to examine, analyse and simulate a range of spatial patterns and processes; be able to use geostatistical tools to analyze and interpolate spatial patterns; appreciate the many different sources of uncertainty in spatial data and spatial processing and how to address such issues in analysis and research; be able to master the key concepts in network analysis with a focus on social and spatial networks (now in Intro to Data Science and Advanced Data Science modules); be able to explain several novel applications of spatial analysis techniques within geographic and social data science applications. Reading list We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under “Library Resources”. This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the start of each week as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses. Module assessment details The assessment for Principles of Spatial Analysis is set across two pieces of separate coursework, weighted at 50% each. The first piece of coursework will involve the completion of a spatial analysis project, based on the theory, concepts and application learnt during the module. A 1,500 word report will be submitted, alongside the code used within the project, which describes the analysis undertaken and the results of the analysis. Further guidance is available on Moodle. The second piece of coursework will be a written (1,500 word) review on a current data science application that uses spatial analysis as its core methodology. The application can be drawn from the lecture material, particularly during Weeks 8 and 9, or one of your own choice. Further guidance us available on Moodle. Useful additional resources Besides the mandatory and recommended reading for this course, there are some additional resources that are worth checking out: MIT’s introduction course on mastering the command line: The Missing Semester of Your CS Education A useful tool to unpack command line instructions: explainshell.com Online resource to develop and check your regular expressions: regexr.com Selecting colour palettes for your map making and data visualisation: colorbrewer 2.0 "],
["spatial-analysis-for-data-science.html", "1 Spatial analysis for data science", " 1 Spatial analysis for data science The first week of PSA will introduce how geography and Geographical Information Science (GIScience) fits within the wider data science discipline and why there is a need to specialise in spatial and social analysis for data science. To provide this understanding, you will first work your way through a short document written specifically for this week to provide an extensive overview to why a geographical understanding to data science is critical to accurate and valid data analysis. Next, through a recorded lecture, you’ll be given a short introduction to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools for spatial data science and an explanation to how these tools have changed over the last decade, including a shift from traditional GIS software towards programming-based analysis in research applications. We’ll then show you examples of different types of GIS software through a recorded tutorial. To gain a practical basic understanding of the differences across these software, including their ease of use, the recorded tutorial will show you the steps and processing to create a simple choropleth map of population and population density in London. This week plays a formative role in providing everyone with baseline from which to not only pursue this module, but the other technical modules on the MSc. This week’s content is available on Moodle.

["geographical-representation.html", "2 Geographical representation", " 2 Geographical representation The first part of this week will look at spatial representation data models, i.e. how we transform geographic features and phenomena into geographic data for use within GIS. We will then explore the role of scale and geography within spatial analysis and provide you with a critical understanding of how both can impact and effect the analysis of data, particularly when looking at ‘event’ type data, i.e. the occurrence of a specific phenomenon over space. We will then introduce you to the role and usage of administrative geographies and discuss how they are subject to the Modifiable Area Unit Problem as well as its the consequences, including ecological fallacies. We will then discuss methods to account for these issues, including population standardization, as well as highlight alternative methods for representing data beyond traditional choropleth maps. The interactive lecture will also introduce the role of projections and what considerations you should make when choosing the projection for your analysis; projections are further discussed in Week 3 of CASA0005. The practical component of the week puts these issues into practice with an analysis of crime data from the UK and its various administrative geographies, as well as voting patterns in the USA. The practical component also introduces the two types of data joining primarily used in spatial analysis: attribute and spatial joins. This week’s content is available on Moodle. "],
["spatial-properties-and-relationships.html", "3 Spatial properties and relationships", " 3 Spatial properties and relationships Understanding spatial properties, relationships and how they are used within spatial operations are the building blocks to spatial data processing and analysis. This week, we look to provide you with a thorough introduction into using spatial operations (and the properties and relationships associated with them) through an introductory lecture, a research-based analysis (with demo and practical) and then a research task which we will look at during this week’s seminar. Within the lecture, we will highlight the different ways of conceptualizing key spatial properties, such as distance, and the impact this may have on measurement. We then focus on their application within spatial operations, and how they can be used for the selection, subset and validation of data. We then look at the core terminology used to define spatial relationships and how they can be used to process datasets, using the operations previously mentioned. The practical utilises these concepts to investigate the accessibility of greenspace for schools across London. Recent research (Bijnens et al, 2020) has shown that children brought up in proximity to greenspace have a higher IQ and fewer behavioral problems, irrespective of socio-economic background. Here we will look to understand whether there are geographical patterns to schools that have high versus low access of greenspace and where a lack of greenspace needs to be addressed. For the practical, we provide an introduction to the research problem and outline how we devise a research methodology to be able to investigate our research questions. We then look at the required processing steps to create the final dataset that can be used in our analysis. This is followed by a short demo in which Jo will demonstrate the analysis visually in QGIS. We then ask you to recreate the analysis by creating a script in R-Studio (code provided) - this will allow you to replicate the analysis for other cities within the U.K, or even further afield if you can extract the same data. Finally, in preparation for this week’s seminar, we ask you to watch a five minute video from a local news channel in Jo’s hometown - ready to discuss as a possible research task in Friday’s seminar. This week’s content is available on Moodle. "]
