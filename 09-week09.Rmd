# Bayesian modelling 

Bayesian methodology is an approach to statistical inference that has existed for a long time. However, its applications have been limited until recent advancements in computation and simulation methods has made its deployment and use within big datasets viable. The concept underlying Bayesian spatial modeling is Bayesâ€™ theorem, which considers both the distributions of the data and the unknown coefficient estimates (LeSage and Pace, 2009). Bayesian spatial modeling embraces most, if not all, spatial models in the literature, such as the spatial lag model, the spatial error model, and geographically weighted regression discussed in Week 5. As a result, recent decades have experienced a rapid growth in the application of Bayesian spatial modeling to epidemiology, demography, and environmental health research, in addition to other geography-related disciplines. Bayesian modelling has been used to estimate population distributions, disease spread and air pollution.

This week provides you with a general introduction to Bayesian modelling for geographical applications, with a focus on understanding the overall methodology as well as selection of variables for use within the model. 

The practical component looks at R-INLA package and how it can be used within health modelling.
